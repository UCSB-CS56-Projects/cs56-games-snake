Code compiles and runs, but response to arrow key inputs is several seconds slow (with X11 forwarding on personal Mac).

From running "ant test" - 2 failed tests:

    [junit] Testcase: test_TwoArgConstructor took 0.003 sec
    [junit] 	      FAILED
    [junit] expected:<15> but was:<0>
    [junit] junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<15> but was:<0>
    [junit] 					  at edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.games.snake.TailTest.test_TwoArgConstructor(TailTest.java:33)

>> Tests for width == 15, but receives width == 0. 
>> Fix TwoArgConstructor to preset width and height to 15
>> DONE

    [junit] Testcase: test_DefaultConstructor took 0.001 sec
    [junit] 	      FAILED
    [junit] expected:<50> but was:<0>

    [junit] 					  at edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.games.snake.TailTest.test_DefaultConstructor(TailTest.java:20)

>> Tests for x position, == 50, gets 0
>> Fix DefaultConstructor for default x position to be 50, default y position to be 50, and default height and width to be 15
>> DONE



Possible Areas of improvement - add Mouse interaction
>> Main Menu / Pause Menu options





ISSUES:

>>
Looking at Issue #13 (Update Artwork to Make Game More Playable #13)
Currently, the "apple" the snake is trying to eat is smaller than the size of the snake, and is placed such that when the snake eats it, the apple is offset from the center of the snake. This makes it difficult to judge the exact location of the apple in relation to the snake.
To improve the playability of the game the size or location of the apple could be altered.
